I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Who am I making this out to? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I'll get my kit!

It doesn't look so shiny to me. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. We need rest. ** The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.** _I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse!_ I asked you to get busy!

## Moving along…

Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!

1. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.
2. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!
3. We don't have a brig.

### Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!

You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Shut up and get to the point! Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.

- There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!
- Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
- Meh.

Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Also Zoidberg. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.

We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Take me to your leader! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!

But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Large bet on myself in round one. I'll get my kit! Bite my shiny metal ass. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.

Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!

It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.

Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! I wish! It's a nickel. Pansy. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! You're going to do his laundry? How much did you make me?

You are the last hope of the universe. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Meh. And then the battle's not so bad?

Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Is the Space Pope reptilian!?
